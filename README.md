# This is a low-tier bot used to cut trees on RuneScape, a popular MMORPG. 
# DISCLAIMER: Using bots, or any other form of automation to perform actions for you is against game rules and will result in a ban. Please use at your own risk. 

# Project takeaways:
- This script needs to be modified depending on the user’s screen resolution. Maybe there’s a way this can be automated?
- The user will need an axe that is of appropriate level to wield in order to chop down logs
- The user will need to be in an area that has trees they are capable of cutting based on their Woodcutting level
- Learned the basics of RobotJS
- Find a way to run away when being attacked
